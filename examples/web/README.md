# Web Example

Browser-based playground for the SDK. Demonstrates three wallet connection strategies (Cartridge Controller, private key, Privy), account deployment, transfers, sponsored (gasless) transactions, and provider-based token swaps on Starknet Sepolia.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- The SDK built locally (this example references the SDK source via aliases in `vite.config.ts`)

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
cd examples/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) for the landing. The Vite dev server hot-reloads both the example and the SDK source thanks to the path aliases configured in `vite.config.ts`.

For the operational dashboard, open [http://localhost:5173/dash](http://localhost:5173/dash).

## Connection Methods

The example supports three independent wallet strategies. Each one initializes the SDK and produces a `WalletInterface` that exposes `execute`, `deploy`, `isDeployed`, `address`, and other standard methods.

### 1. Cartridge Controller

**How to use:** Click **Cartridge**. A popup window opens for Cartridge's session-based authentication (social login or WebAuthn). No server or extra setup is required.

**What happens under the hood:**

1. The SDK calls `sdk.onboard()` with `OnboardStrategy.Cartridge`.
2. Internally, a `SessionProvider` from `@cartridge/controller` is created with the configured session policies.
3. The Cartridge popup handles account creation/login and grants the app a scoped session.
4. Cartridge manages the account contract deployment and funding, so you don't need STRK balance to start.

**Session policies** are pre-configured in `main.ts` and define what the session is allowed to do:

```typescript
const DUMMY_POLICY = {
  target: "0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d", // STRK token
  method: "transfer",
};
```

This grants the session permission to call `transfer` on the STRK contract. Transactions outside these policies will be rejected.

### 2. Private Key

**How to use:** Click **Private Key** to expand the form. Enter a hex private key (`0x...`) or click the dice button to generate a random Stark-curve key. Select an account preset, then click **Connect**.

**What happens under the hood:**

1. A `StarkSigner` is created from the private key.
2. The SDK calls `sdk.onboard()` with `OnboardStrategy.Signer` and the chosen `accountPreset`.
3. The deterministic account address is computed from the signer's public key and the preset's class hash + constructor calldata.
4. The wallet is ready to sign transactions locally.

**Account presets** determine which on-chain account contract is used:

| Preset         | Description                                           |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| OpenZeppelin   | Standard OpenZeppelin account contract                |
| Argent         | Argent account contract                               |
| ArgentX v0.5.0 | ArgentX-specific version (also used by Privy wallets) |
| Braavos        | Braavos account contract                              |
| Devnet         | Devnet-compatible account (for local Starknet devnet) |

**New account workflow:**

1. After connecting, the address is computed but the contract is not yet deployed on-chain.
2. Copy the address using the clipboard button.
3. Fund it with STRK on Sepolia (via a faucet like [starknet-faucet.vercel.app](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app) or from another wallet).
4. Click **Deploy Account** to submit the deploy transaction.
5. Once deployed, use **Test Transfer** or **Sponsored Tx** to verify the account works end-to-end.

### 3. Privy (Server-Managed Keys)

**How to use:** Click **Privy**, enter an email address, select an account preset, then click **Connect**. Requires the companion server to be running (see [Server Setup](#server-setup-privy--paymaster) below).

**What happens under the hood:**

1. The web app sends a health check to `http://localhost:3001/api/health`.
2. A POST to `/api/user/register` creates or retrieves a Privy Starknet wallet for the given email.
3. The server returns the wallet ID, public key, and address.
4. The SDK calls `sdk.onboard()` with `OnboardStrategy.Privy`, passing a `resolve` callback that returns the wallet ID, public key, and signing server URL.
5. A `PrivySigner` is created internally. All subsequent signing requests are sent to the server's `/api/wallet/sign` endpoint, which calls the Privy Node SDK to sign the hash remotely.
6. The account address is computed the same way as private key mode (public key + preset class hash).

This strategy keeps the private key entirely on Privy's infrastructure. The web app never has access to it. The same new-account workflow applies: fund the address, then deploy.

## Server Setup (Privy + Paymaster)

The `examples/server/` directory contains an Express server that provides two services:

1. **Privy wallet proxy** -- creates Starknet wallets via the Privy Node SDK, stores user-to-wallet mappings in a local JSON file, and signs transaction hashes on behalf of users.
2. **AVNU paymaster proxy** -- forwards paymaster JSON-RPC requests to AVNU's paymaster endpoint, injecting your API key so the client never exposes it.

### Environment Variables

```bash
cd examples/server
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

| Variable             | Required | Default                             | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PRIVY_APP_ID`       | Yes      | --                                  | Your Privy application ID (from the [Privy dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io)) |
| `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`   | Yes      | --                                  | Your Privy application secret                                                      |
| `AVNU_API_KEY`       | Yes      | --                                  | AVNU paymaster API key (enables sponsored/gasless mode)                            |
| `AVNU_PAYMASTER_URL` | No       | `https://sepolia.paymaster.avnu.fi` | Override the paymaster endpoint (e.g. for mainnet)                                 |

### Installing and Running

Install server dependencies:

```bash
cd examples/server
npm install
```

Then from the `examples/web/` directory, run everything together:

```bash
npm run dev:all
```

This uses `concurrently` to start the Vite dev server (port 5173) and the Express server (port 3001) in parallel.

Or run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 -- Vite dev server (port 5173)
cd examples/web
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 -- Express server (port 3001)
cd examples/server
npx tsx server.ts
```

### Server Endpoints

The Express server (port 3001) exposes these routes:

| Endpoint                       | Method | Auth         | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/health`                  | GET    | No           | Returns `{ status: "ok" }`. Used by the web app to check if the server is reachable before attempting Privy operations.                                            |
| `/api/wallet/starknet`         | POST   | Bearer token | Creates a new Starknet wallet via Privy or returns the existing one for the authenticated user. Returns `{ wallet: { id, address, publicKey }, accounts, isNew }`. |
| `/api/wallet/register-account` | POST   | Bearer token | Associates a computed account address with a preset for the user. Body: `{ preset, address, deployed? }`.                                                          |
| `/api/wallet/set-deployed`     | POST   | Bearer token | Updates the deployment status of a registered account. Body: `{ preset, deployed }`.                                                                               |
| `/api/wallet/sign`             | POST   | No           | Signs a transaction hash using a Privy wallet. Body: `{ walletId, hash }`. Returns `{ signature }`.                                                                |
| `/api/paymaster`               | POST   | No           | Proxies the request body to the AVNU paymaster URL, attaching the `x-paymaster-api-key` header. Returns the paymaster response as-is.                              |

Wallet data is persisted in `wallets.json` (auto-created). This is a simple file store for development -- use a real database in production.

## Wallet Actions

Once connected (via any strategy), the wallet panel appears with these actions:

| Action             | Button           | What it does                                                                                                                                            | When it can fail                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Check Status**   | `Check Status`   | Calls `wallet.isDeployed()` which queries the RPC node for the account's contract class. Updates the status badge to "Deployed" or "Not Deployed".      | RPC node is unreachable or rate-limited.                                                                       |
| **Deploy Account** | `Deploy Account` | Calls `wallet.deploy()` to submit a `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT` transaction. Waits for on-chain confirmation via `tx.wait()`.                                      | Account has no STRK balance to pay gas. Account is already deployed. The class hash is not declared on-chain.  |
| **Test Transfer**  | `Test Transfer`  | Executes a 0-STRK transfer to self (`wallet.execute()` with `transfer(self, 0)`). A safe, no-op transaction to verify end-to-end signing and execution. | Account is not deployed. Insufficient STRK for gas.                                                            |
| **Sponsored Tx**   | `Sponsored Tx`   | Same 0-STRK self-transfer, but with `{ feeMode: "sponsored" }`. Gas fees are paid by the AVNU paymaster instead of the account.                         | Server not running. `AVNU_API_KEY` not set or invalid. Paymaster doesn't support the account class or network. |
| **Copy Address**   | Clipboard icon   | Copies the full account address to clipboard.                                                                                                           | Clipboard API not available (non-HTTPS).                                                                       |
| **Disconnect**     | `Disconnect`     | Clears wallet state. For Cartridge wallets, also calls `disconnect()` to end the session.                                                               | --                                                                                                             |

The **Activity Log** at the bottom of the page shows timestamped events for every action: connection details, public keys, transaction hashes, explorer links, confirmation status, and errors.

## Swap Demo (Provider API)

The connected wallet card includes a **Swap** section with:

- source selector (`AVNU` or `Ekubo`)
- token-in and token-out selectors from SDK token presets
- amount + slippage input
- `Get Quote` (calls `wallet.getQuote({ provider, ... })`)
- `Submit Swap` (calls `wallet.swap({ provider, ... }, options?)`)

This example uses the simplified request shape where `provider` is part of the request object:

```ts
await wallet.getQuote({
  provider: "avnu",
  tokenIn,
  tokenOut,
  amountIn,
  slippageBps: 100n,
});

await wallet.swap(
  {
    provider: "ekubo",
    tokenIn,
    tokenOut,
    amountIn,
    slippageBps: 100n,
  },
  { feeMode: "sponsored" }
);
```

## Configuration

### Network

The app connects to Starknet Sepolia by default. To change the network, edit the constants at the top of `main.ts`:

```typescript
const RPC_URL = "https://api.cartridge.gg/x/starknet/sepolia/rpc/v0_9";

const sdk = new OpenTheDoorz({
  rpcUrl: RPC_URL,
  chainId: ChainId.SEPOLIA,
});
```

For mainnet, change both `RPC_URL` and `ChainId.SEPOLIA` to `ChainId.MAINNET`, and set `AVNU_PAYMASTER_URL` in the server's `.env` to `https://mainnet.paymaster.avnu.fi`.

### Privy Server URL

The Privy server URL defaults to `http://localhost:3001`. Change it in `main.ts` if your server runs elsewhere:

```typescript
const PRIVY_SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:3001";
```

### Vite Path Aliases

`vite.config.ts` maps SDK imports to `../../src/index.ts` and `@` to `../../src/`. This means:

- `import { OpenTheDoorz } from "starkzap"` resolves to the local SDK source, not a published npm bundle.
- Changes to the SDK source are hot-reloaded automatically.
- The `optimizeDeps.exclude: ["starkzap"]` setting prevents Vite from pre-bundling the SDK.
